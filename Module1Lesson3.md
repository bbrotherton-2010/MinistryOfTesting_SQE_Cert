<h2>Activity: Connecting the benefits of Quality Engineering to context </h2>
Choose one or more of the 7 benefits of highly effective Quality Engineering discussed in the cosmic conversation.

For each benefit you have chosen, write an example of a context where that benefit becomes especially important. You can use one of the scenarios mentioned in the conversation or draw from your own experience.

Examples of contexts you might use include:

* team working at high speed
* product with many users
* mobile app with strict release constraints
* company guided by OKRs
* startup preparing for a major launch
* team with unclear requirements or communication gaps
Consider:

What makes this benefit valuable in that context?

What problem does it help reduce or avoid?

Would this benefit look different in another environment?


<h2>Answer</h2>

**Benefit**: Quality Engineering improves communication and shared understanding

**Context**: Involves QA/Testers at the beginning of the SDLC.  This allows any assumptions to be cleared up, questions to be raised earlier, less rework for developers, and opens communication across the different roles early.  Open communication is important to ensure understanding.  If you're only talking to someone at the end of development, it's not as easy to start conversations and ask questions.  Routine conversations and interactions make it less awkward to ask questions and raise concerns.  The deadline isn't looming and there's more time to pivot if the need arrises

**Benefit**: Quality Engineering links technical issues to business and customer impact

**Context**: QE bridges the gaps between development and customers.  It helps to minimize rework and allows the devs to see the changes from the user point of view.  QE can communicate in technical terms and non-technical language so they can help to explain to both sides in a way they'll understand
