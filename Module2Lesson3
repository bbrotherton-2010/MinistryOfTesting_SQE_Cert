A Quality Engineer action

Responding to questions and exploring uncertainty
 * This is one of my favorite things to do.  Whether it's figuring out how to reproduce a bug or figuring out how an undocumeted legacy feature works.
 * It also includes answering testing questions during refinement of stories, or on the fly when there's a hotfix needed in production.
 * Reviewing the early versions of features being develops allows us to make sure that things like usability and accessibility are included from the beginning
