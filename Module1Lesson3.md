 Connecting the benefits of Quality Engineering to context 

**Benefit**: Quality Engineering improves communication and shared understanding

**Context**: Involves QA/Testers at the beginning of the SDLC.  This allows any assumptions to be cleared up, questions to be raised earlier, less rework for developers, and opens communication across the different roles early.  Open communication is important to ensure understanding.  If you're only talking to someone at the end of development, it's not as easy to start conversations and ask questions.  Routine conversations and interactions make it less awkward to ask questions and raise concerns.  The deadline isn't looming and there's more time to pivot if the need arrises

**Benefit**: Quality Engineering links technical issues to business and customer impact

**Context**: QE bridges the gaps between development and customers.  It helps to minimize rework and allows the devs to see the changes from the user point of view.  QE can communicate in technical terms and non-technical language so they can help to explain to both sides in a way they'll understand
