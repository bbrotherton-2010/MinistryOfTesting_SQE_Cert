<h2>Activity: Reflecting on changes in quality responsibilities </h2>
Take a moment to reflect on your time in software testing, and capture it in your portfolio. Why not also head over to this Club post to share your story and learn from others.

* What changes have you seen in how teams approach quality and testing?
* How have your own responsibilities or mindset changed as testing moved towards Quality Engineering?
* Which practices or ideas that once felt current now seem outdated? What replaced them?
* What advice would you give to someone adapting to these changes in quality responsibilities?

It’s interesting to look back with this mindset. I only had one job that had what could be described as test managers and testers. I was a tester and it sucked. It was also before I accepted my fate to be in QA and not development.   I think my experience is unique because I didn’t see changes at one company, I have moved around quite a bit. The changes came with new jobs.

I definitely had some positions where I was excluded from meetings because they didn’t think it was important. I don’t think it had anything to do with titles, it was just thinking that the only thing I did was testing and “anyone can test”. One company had a Project Manager who thought QA was not needed because the BAs could test. If the management saw QA as an asset instead of a hurdle, then I was able to have a valuable contribution.

The one job I had that changed the position the most for me was when the QA that was already there expected to be involved in everything. If she said QA needed to be included, we were. I know it was frustrating for the Devs, but they didn’t exclude us because they saw our value. Seeing her confidence in her ability and value really helped me to see my own. In all positions after, I did the same. I insisted on being involved. If I wasn’t, I knew it was a choice to exclude, like the Project Manager that didn’t think QA was necessary because the BAs could “test” just as well.

I don’t know that there was any difference on what my title was. I was always “QA” or “Tester” or something similar. The difference came from how upper management saw QA. If it was an asset rather than a hurdle, I was able to have a valuable contribution

I had a college class that taught UI/UX before it was called that and I’ve always looked at applications from the concepts I learned there. Some of the things I learned have actually turned into accessibility requirements. For example: navigating a form with only the keyboard was because some users were transitioning from systems without a mouse or because data entry is faster that way. Now, it’s looked at more for accessibility so people who have mobility challenges can still use forms.

Some of my biggest impacts is always a product of the curiosity asking “I wonder what happens if I would do x”. So many breaking bugs, astonished Devs going “How did you find that??”. As much as I try to teach others to do that, it seems to be something good QAs are more likely to chase.
