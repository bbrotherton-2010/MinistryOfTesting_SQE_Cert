<h2>Activity: Applying quality engineering in practice </h2>
Choose one or more core approaches to Quality Engineering:

* Shift everywhere
* Improving developer experience
* Education
* Stakeholder-relations
* Systems thinking
* Culture shift

Describe how you could apply that approach at one stage of the software development lifecycle (for example, planning, development, or deployment).

Capture your thoughts in your portfolio.

Consider:

What value would this approach bring at that stage?
What challenges might you face when applying it?
How would it differ from how you worked before adopting QE practices?

<h2>Answer</h2>

I'm a big propnent of Shift everywhere, although I didn't have a name for it until now.  I believe that involving QA in all stages of the SDLC is valuable because, as QEs, we have a unique point of view.  We look for how things can break or what can happen if X occurs.  We are thinking of paths outside of the happy path.  We're thinking of the users and how people actually use the software as opposed to how they *should* use it.

Planning, in particular, is a place that I see QEs being excluded, but would be very beneficial.  When I have been included at that stage, I'll ask questions that no one has thought of yet.  I'll make sure all the details are included.  Make sure the standard items are defined like security, required fields, etc.  If there's a requirement of "make liks other page", then I'll make sure that we get exact requirements.  Sometimes the benefit is just bringing up these questions sooner in the SDLC before it requires a huge change after development has already begun.

In the past, where QE has been excluded, these questions are asked during active development.  They may cause delays while product gets the answeers or while development rewrites code that was done based on an assumption instead of asking.  If the feature/work is delayed, then it will be delayed getting to our customeers which will lower their perception of our reliability.
